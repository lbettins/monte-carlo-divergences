# Distributions Wrapper
The Distributions wrapper is a Python package to compute statistical measures of entropy and divergence from probability distributions and samples.

The following functionality is provided:
* Entropy
* Relative Entropy or Kullback-Leibler (KL-) Divergence
* Jensen-Shannon (JS-) Divergence

The unit in which these entropy and divergence measures are calculated is nats. 

## Installation

<pre>
    pip install distributions-wrapper
